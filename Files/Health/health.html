                        According to the definition of World Council of Optometry (WCO), an organization that represents
                        optometrists worldwide, “optometrists are the primary healthcare practitioners of the eye and
                        visual system who provide comprehensive eye and vision care, which includes refraction and
                        dispensing, detection/diagnosis and management of disease in the eye, and the rehabilitation of
                        conditions of the visual system”. While, an estimated 456 million people in India require vision
                        correction (spectacles, contact lenses or refractive surgery) to be able to see and function,
                        the demand for optometrists is very high and is expected to rise further in the coming years.
                        With enormous job opportunities in India and abroad, Optometry has come out as a lucrative
                        carrier option through which financial growth, social respect, and professional satisfaction can
                        be achieved.

                        a very specialized environment of learning which is based on well equipped class rooms,
                        laboratories on optics and clinical diagnosis. In total four years of optometry trainings, the
                        initial three years would comprise of class room teaching, lab oriented training, hand-on with
                        optometry instruments, observation of real case studies, industrial visits, conferences and
                        works shops. To increase the quality of diagnosis of the students, an in-house optometry clinic
                        has been set where variety of optometry specialties including comprehensive eye care, contact
                        lens, low vision rehabilitation, binocular vision can be practiced.<br>In the final year of
                        training, the student would be placed at tertiary eye care hospitals for clinical internship.
                        Furthermore, students would be given opportunity to understand and participate in vision
                        researches under the guidance of experienced mentors, competent in optometry and ophthalmology
                        researches. Thus, an alumnus of SKFGI- Optometry, would not only be academically and clinically
                        competent, but would also possess strong understanding of vision researches.

                        science and opting to know more about the national and international standards of the laboratory
                        in detail. The course aims to provide the candidate with adequate knowledge and skills to carry
                        out routine and some sophisticated laboratory diagnostic procedures. Students would acquire
                        theoretical knowledge related to the principles of the laboratory exercises and will also learn
                        to to deal with new advances in instrumentation, methodology or standardization, Management of
                        Laboratories, Standard Protocols and use of technology that is related to Laboratory
                        Investigations.<br>Medical laboratory technologists do routine laboratory testing under
                        stipulated conditions. Technologists may prepare specimens and operate machines that
                        automatically analyze samples. The medical technologists are an integral part of the medical
                        profession and get involved in practical and technical work to aid correct diagnosis and in the
                        effective functioning of Biochemical Laboratories.
