                            Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and
                            demand of
                            engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree
                            will
                            never
                            be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every
                            sector,
                            right from
                            construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.<br>
                            B.Tech Mechanical Engineering is the branch of engineering that involves production,
                            designing, and
                            operations of machines. The course objective of mechanical engineering is to prepare
                            students for
                            applying the principles of mechanical engineering for designing, manufacturing, and
                            maintenance of
                            mechanical systems.
